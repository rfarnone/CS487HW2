Part 1 of this project required making a CNN using VGG16 to categorize 101 different types of objects. After creating a CNN with a required 90% accuracy we implemented White-box Evasion attacks using FGSM, PGM, and C&W L2 attacks on the CNN. Through the Jupyter Notebook file there are tables recording the results of the attacks and it closes with a paragraph describing the C&W L2 attack and its differences from FGSM and PGD attacks.
Part 2 of this project required making a CNN using ViT to categorize pictues of 62 different celebrities. After creating this model we used specific images from the test set to see how much pertubation was required for https://www.clarifai.com/models/celebrity-face-recognition to misclassify them using PGD attacks.
