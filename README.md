This project required making a CNN to categorize 101 different types of objects. After creating a CNN with a required 90% accuracy we implemented White-box Evasion attacks using FGSM, PGM, and C&W L2 attacks on the CNN. Through the Jupyter Notebook file there are tables recording the results of the attacks and it closes with a paragraph describing the C&W L2 attack and its differences from FGSM and PGD attacks.
